    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p id="about">Farfan Fantasy Football was created by myself, Delfino Farfan. I'm a graduate of Texas A&M University, and studied Leadership Education and Development with a minor in Sports Management. I've enjoyed football since I was introduced to the game at a young age, but now I find myself viewing the sport more often than I play it. As a spectator I crave interaction, and Fantasy Football has allowed me to feel more connected to the game I enjoy so much! I soon realized that I was not as competitive as I had hoped to be, and my biggest shortcoming was not properly evaluating talent. I found I was unable to properly evaluate talent due to a lack of available time. Although I enjoy Fantasy Football it couldn't be prioritized over other responsibilities (ex.lawn work, job, kids, etc.) and that's when Farfan Fantasy Football was born. Farfan Fantasy Football was created to help Fantasty Football players that want an advantage over their league mates, but can't pour through the film/data themselves. Farfan Fantasy Football provides the best of both world and has scores for incoming rookies based on both film and metrics.</p>
